# ReACT - REsource Audit and Comparison Tool

## Summary

The aim of this project is to produce a generic tool for comparing
lists or directories of files, allowing the user to specify what it is
they want to compare, whether they want the tool to work recursively
through directories and to specify what particular file types should
be matched if appropriate (docs with pdfs for example). 

The generic tool should take into consideration further issues
highlighted by the ADS when testing the tool post mash-up, such as the
requirement to identify the exact location of files with the same name
and order the results lists by filename. The project will build on
initial work to address some specific challenges identified at the
Glasgow Mashup, resulting in a more widely useful preservation tool.

## Acknowledgements
This ReACT tool has been developed by Andrew Amato (London School of Economics and Political Science) in conjunction with Ray Moore (Archaeology Data Service). The tool was developed at the SPRUCE (Sustainable PReservation Using Community Engagement) mash-up in Glasgow (16th-18 April 2012) and subsequently by funding from SPRUCE. 

The SPRUCE project has been funded by JISC to inspire, guide, support and enable HE, FE and cultural institutions to address digital preservation gaps; and to use the knowledge gathered from that activity to articulate a compelling business case for digital preservation. http://www.dpconline.org/advocacy/spruce.
