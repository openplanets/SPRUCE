Installation:
Copy all files to a convenient location and run commands below. You might want to change the location of the ExifTool executable, which can be done by changing the very first line of code in the script (variable $exiftool).

Usage:
       php exif_to_dc.php file=FILENAME
       php exif_to_dc.php folder=FOLDERNAME ; (NOTE: recursive!)
Optionally, specify an XML output file:
       php exif_to_dc.php file=FILENAME|folder=FOLDERNAME xmlout=FILE.xml
otherwise it will print XML to STDOUT

Background:
This OS-independent tool enables you to read EXIF-data from an image file using ExifTool and 
normalise this to Dublin Core compatible XML adding specific metadata which is contained in an 
.ini file. The XML output templates can be tailored to one's needs. Tool is able to handle 
single files, or recurse trough a folder. Output is written to STDOUT, unless an output XML 
file is specified.

Please note this tool is a prototype and adds very specific institutional metadata from The 
State University of New York at Binghamton, though the code can be changed very easy to your 
own needs.
